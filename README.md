# yt-calc-channel-viewtime
Calculates any given YT channel's total viewtime across all videos.

I originally created this to collect empirical data for a hypothetical asking whether you'd rather watch every episode of
[Sesame Street](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Sesame_Street_seasons) or [Annoying Orange](https://www.youtube.com/@AnnoyingOrange) in one sitting, but have since generalized it for any number of YT channels.

Takes channelIDs as input, these can be found using online tools like [this one](https://www.streamweasels.com/%20tools/youtube-channel-id-and-%20user-id-convertor/)
